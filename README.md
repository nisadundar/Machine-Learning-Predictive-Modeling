Project: Assignment

Description: This project involves developing a machine learning model using data stored in AWS S3 and deploying the model as a REST API.

Main Files:
data_gathering.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for connecting to AWS S3 and importing data to pandas.
model_development.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for preparing data, training and comparing models, and exporting the best model.
api_development.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for designing and developing a REST API for model inference.
architecture_design.png: PNG file containing the architecture design diagram for both on-premises and cloud-based environments.

Tools:
AWS S3
Pandas
Python
Machine learning libraries (scikit-learn)
REST API framework (Flask)

Files:
Data_Transfer.py: Main Python file
data.parquet: Data file
Required Python libraries

How to Use:
